## Taxonomic Composition

Before we can start to understand a system, we need to know something about its parts. So lets start by looking at taxonomic diversity.

<br/>

### Total reads & ASVs

 We will look at Class level diversity but you can of course change this to any taxonomic rank you wish. Here we created a **sortable** table that has the total number of reads and ASVs for each class

```{r diversity_table, fig.align = "center", cache=TRUE}
# generate the ASV table
tax_asv <- table(tax_table(ps_slv_work_filt)[, "Class"],
                 exclude = NULL, dnn = "Taxa")
tax_asv <- as.data.frame(tax_asv, make.names = TRUE)

#### change <NA> to Unclassified
# Get levels and add "None"
levels <- levels(tax_asv$Taxa)
levels[length(levels) + 1] <- "Unclassified"
# refactor Taxa to include "Unclassified" as a factor level
# and replace NA with "Unclassified"
tax_asv$Taxa <- factor(tax_asv$Taxa, levels = levels)
tax_asv$Taxa[is.na(tax_asv$Taxa)] <- "Unclassified"

# generate the reads table
tax_reads <- factor(tax_table(ps_slv_work_filt)[, "Class"], exclude = NULL)
tax_reads <- apply(otu_table(ps_slv_work_filt), MARGIN = 1,
                   function(x) {
                     tapply(x, INDEX = tax_reads,
                                       FUN = sum, na.rm = FALSE,
                                       simplify = TRUE)})

#RENAME NA --> Unclassified
rownames(tax_reads)[72] <- "Unclassified"

tax_reads <- as.data.frame(tax_reads, make.names = TRUE)
tax_reads <- cbind(tax_reads, reads = rowSums(tax_reads))
#DELETE all but last column
tax_reads <- tax_reads[51]
tax_reads <- setDT(tax_reads, keep.rownames = TRUE)[]
# merge the two tables and make everything look pretty
# in an interactive table

taxa_read_asv_tab <- merge(tax_reads, tax_asv, by.x = "rn", by.y = "Taxa")
taxa_read_asv_tab <- mutate(taxa_read_asv_tab,
                            prop_of_ASVs = Freq / sum(Freq),
                            prop_of_reads = reads / sum(reads))
taxa_read_asv_tab <- taxa_read_asv_tab[c(1, 2, 5, 3, 4)]

names(taxa_read_asv_tab) <- c("Class", "total_reads", "prop_of_reads",
                              "total_ASVs", "prop_of_ASVs")

taxa_read_asv_tab2 <- taxa_read_asv_tab
taxa_read_asv_tab2$prop_of_reads <- round(taxa_read_asv_tab2$prop_of_reads,
                                          digits = 6)
taxa_read_asv_tab2$prop_of_ASVs <- round(taxa_read_asv_tab2$prop_of_ASVs,
                                         digits = 6)
```

For your information, the dataset has a total of **`r format(sum(tax_reads$reads), scientific = FALSE)`** reads across **`r sum(tax_asv$Freq)`** ASVs.

<div class="paper">Table S4 from paper</div>

```{r cache=TRUE}
#kills sci notation
options(scipen = 999)
write.table(taxa_read_asv_tab2, "DATA/PHYLOSEQ/TABLES/OUTPUT/SUPP/Table_S4.txt",
            sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE)

datatable(taxa_read_asv_tab2, rownames = FALSE, width = "100%",
          colnames = c("Class", "total_reads", "prop_of_reads",
                       "total_ASVs", "prop_of_ASVs"),
          caption =
            htmltools::tags$caption(
              style = "caption-side: bottom; text-align: left;",
              "Table: ",
              htmltools::em("Total reads & ASVs by Class")),
          extensions = "Buttons",
          options = list(columnDefs =
                           list(list(className = "dt-left", targets = 0)),
                         dom = "Blfrtip", pageLength = 5,
                         lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 35, 70),
                         buttons = c("csv", "copy")))
```


Looks like Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes dominate in the read department. Curiously, Fusobacteria has comparatively low ASV richness.

Much of the analyses we do from here on out will be at the **Class** & **Family** levels. We chose not to focus on the Genus level because there simply is not enough resolution in our dataset to build a cohesive story. This is because these fish are (microbially) understudied *and* we are dealing with short read data. On the other hand, Phylum level is too coarse for groups like Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Order did not provide any additional information and can be cumbersome for taxa with poorly resolved lineages. Depending on the dataset, you may want to change your strategy.

Lets take a closer look Class-level taxonomic content of these communities. There are numerous ways to do this but here we chose to collapse samples by host species and display the relative abundance of the most dominant taxa. We also generated alternative views of taxonomic composition for individual samples---a box-and-whisker plot as well as bar plots separated by host and taxa. The figures and code are available in <a href="1_field_observations.html">Appendix A</a>.

Stacked bar charts are not the best but we like them for a birds eye view of the data. Here we calculate the relative abundance of taxa for each host species at the **Class** level. It turns out this is not too easy in phyloseq and there is a lot of (messy) code.

```{r calc_rel_abund_and_merge, cache=TRUE}
# calculate the averages and merge by species
ps_slv_filt_AVG <- transform_sample_counts(ps_slv_work_filt,
                                           function(x) x / sum(x))
mergedGP_BAR <- merge_samples(ps_slv_filt_AVG, "Sp")
SD_BAR <- merge_samples(sample_data(ps_slv_filt_AVG), "Sp")

# merge taxa by rank. If you choose a different rank be sure to change
# the rank throughout this code chunk
mdata_phy <- tax_glom(mergedGP_BAR, taxrank = "Class", NArm = FALSE)
mdata_phyrel <- transform_sample_counts(mdata_phy, function(x) x / sum(x))
meltd <- psmelt(mdata_phyrel)
meltd$Class <- as.character(meltd$Class)

# calculate the total relative abundance for all taxa
means <- ddply(meltd, ~Class, function(x) c(mean = mean(x$Abundance)))
means$mean <- round(means$mean, digits = 8)
# this order in decending fashion
taxa_means <- means[order(-means$mean), ]
# ditch the sci notation
taxa_means <- format(taxa_means, scientific = FALSE)
#RENAME NA to UNCLASSIFIED
taxa_means$Class <- gsub("NA", "Unclassified", taxa_means$Class)
```

Since our goal is to generate a figure and we only have 9 colors, some taxa will need to be put into an **Other** category. We can define 'Other' however we like so lets take a look at the overall relative abundance of each Class.

<br/>

### Relative abundance

<a id="relative abundance phyloseq object"></a>


```{r rel_abund_table, fig.align = 'center', cache=TRUE}

datatable(taxa_means, rownames = FALSE, width = "65%",
          colnames = c("Class", "mean"), caption =
            htmltools::tags$caption(style = "caption-side: bottom;
                                    text-align: left;", "Table: ",
                                    htmltools::em("Class-level
                                                  relative abundance.")),
          extensions = "Buttons",
          options = list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-center",
                                                targets = "_all")),
                         dom = "Blfrtip", pageLength = 10,
                         lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 50, 70),
                         buttons = c("csv", "copy")))
```

Inspecting the table it looks like if we choose a cutoff of 2% (0.02) we get 9 taxa---sounds pretty good. The rest go into the 'Other' category. No matter what, we will always gloss over some groups using such a coarse approach. But as we will see later, some of these low abundance groups will reappear when we look at the level of individual ASVs.

Here we define the **Other** category by combining all taxa with less than 2% of total reads.


```{r define_other, cache=TRUE}
Other <- means[means$mean <= 0.02, ]$Class
# or you can chose specifc taxa like this
# Other_manual <- c("list", "taxa", "in", "this", "format")
```

At a 2% abundance cutoff, `r length(Other)` Classes are grouped into the 'Other' category. Next we will melt all these classes into the **Other** category and then craft the bar chart. It took some tweaking to get the bar chart to look just right---so there is a lot of code here---and it could most certainly be better. While we're at it, we will also save a copy of the figure so we can tweak it later and make it look pretty.


```{r metld_bar, cache=TRUE}
meltd[meltd$Class %in% Other, ]$Class <- "Other"
samp_names <- aggregate(meltd$Abundance,
                        by = list(meltd$Sample), FUN = sum)[, 1]
.e <- environment()
meltd[, "Class"] <- factor(meltd[, "Class"], sort(unique(meltd[, "Class"])))
meltd <- meltd[order(meltd[, "Class"]), ]
# Here we order Classes by the Phylum they belong to.
meltd$Class <- factor(meltd$Class,
                      levels = c("Bacteroidia", "Clostridia",
                                 "Erysipelotrichia", "Fusobacteriia",
                                 "Alphaproteobacteria", "Deltaproteobacteria",
                                 "Gammaproteobacteria", "Planctomycetacia",
                                 "Oxyphotobacteria", "Other"))
```

### Abundance by host species

Armed with a picture of taxonomic composition we can move on to diversity estimates.

## Alpha-Diversity

<br/>

### Statistical tests


Alpha diversity describes the diversity in a sample or site.  There are several alpha diversity metrics available in phyloseq: `Observed`, `Chao1`, `ACE`, `Shannon`, `Simpson`, `InvSimpson`, `Fisher`. Play around to see how different metrics change or confirm these results.

Here we want to know if diversity is significantly different across host species. In order to do that we need to know if we should run a parametric or non-parametric test, and for that we need to know if our data is normally distributed. Most of the ideas/code for alpha (and subsequent beta) diversity statistics come from this [workshop tutorial](https://rpubs.com/maddieSC/R_SOP_UCR_Jan_2018){target="_blank"} by Kim Dill-McFarland and Madison Cox.

First we run the diversity estimates, add these data to our summary table, and save a copy of this table.


<div class="paper">Table S3 from paper</div>


```{r gen_summary_table, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
diversity <- estimate_richness(ps_slv_work_filt,
                               measures = c("Observed", "Chao1", "ACE",
                                          "Shannon", "Simpson", "InvSimpson",
                                          "Fisher"))

diversity_calc <- diversity %>% rownames_to_column("host_ID")
# round values
diversity_calc[c(3, 5, 10)] <- round(diversity_calc[c(3, 5, 10)], 1)
diversity_calc[c(4, 6, 7, 9)] <- round(diversity_calc[c(4, 6, 7, 9)], 2)
diversity_calc[8] <- round(diversity_calc[8], 3)

host_summary <- merge(host_details, diversity_calc)
host_summary$Observed <- NULL
host_summary <- host_summary[c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,
                               14, 15, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23)]

write.table(host_summary, "DATA/PHYLOSEQ/TABLES/OUTPUT/SUPP/Table_S3.txt",
            sep = "\t", row.names = FALSE, quote = FALSE,
            col.names = c("Sample ID", "Host genus", "Host species",
                          "Common name", "NCBI tAxID", "Collection date",
                          "Life phase", "Weight (g)", "Total length (cm)",
                          "Foregut length (cm)", "Midgut length (cm)",
                          "Hindgut length (cm)", "Total gut length (cm)",

                          "ACE", "ACE (se)", "Shannon", "Simpson",
                          "InvSimpson", "Fisher"))

datatable(host_summary, rownames = FALSE, width = "100%",
          colnames = c("Sample ID", "Host genus", "Host species",
                       "Common name", "NCBI tAxID", "Collection date",
                       "Life phase", "Weight (g)", "Total length (cm)",
                       "Foregut length (cm)", "Midgut length (cm)",
                       "Hindgut length (cm)", "Total gut length (cm)",
                       "Total reads", "Total ASVs", "Chao1", "Chao1 (se)",
                       "ACE", "ACE (se)", "Shannon", "Simpson", "InvSimpson",
                       "Fisher"),
            caption =
            htmltools::tags$caption(style =
                                      "caption-side: bottom; text-align:
                                    left;", "Table: ",
                                    htmltools::em("Host-associated metadata &
                                                  microbial diversity")),
          extensions = "Buttons", options =
            list(columnDefs = list(list(className = "dt-left", targets = 0)),
                 dom = "Blfrtip", pageLength = 5, lengthMenu = c(5, 10, 50),
                 buttons = c("csv", "copy"), scrollX = TRUE,
                 scrollCollapse = TRUE))
```

<p id="notice">
This table also scrolls horizontally.
</p>


Next, we add the diversity estimates to our phyloseq object, and test if the data are normally distributed using Shapiro-Wilk Normality test. We will focus on the inverse Simpson and Shannon diversity estimates and Chao’s richness estimate  but this approach can be used for any metric.

```{r alpha_div_test_norm, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# Convert to ps object
sample_div <- sample_data(diversity)
# Create new ps object with diversity estimates added to sample_data
ps_slv_work_filt_div <- merge_phyloseq(ps_slv_work_filt, sample_div)
# Run Shapiro test
shapiro_test_Shan <- shapiro.test(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt_div)$Shannon)
shapiro_test_invSimp <- shapiro.test(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt_div)$InvSimpson)
shapiro_test_Chao1 <- shapiro.test(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt_div)$Chao1)
shapiro_test_Observed <- shapiro.test(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt_div)$Observed)
```

Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test for **Shannon** index.
```{r shap_Shan, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
shapiro_test_Shan
```

Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test for **inverse Simpson** index.
```{r shap_invS, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
shapiro_test_invSimp
```

Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test for **Chao1 richness** estimator.
```{r shap_Choa1, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
shapiro_test_Chao1
```

Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test for **Observed ASV richness** estimator.
```{r shap_Observed, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
shapiro_test_Observed
```

Ok, since the p-values are significant for the inverse Simpson, Chao richness, and Observed ASV richness we reject the null hypothesis that these data are normally distributed. However, the Shannon estimates appear normally distributed. So lets see if diversity is significantly different between host species based on the Shannon index.

<br/>

#### Normally distributed

Since the Shannon data is normally distributed we can test for significance using ANOVA (a parametric test).

```{r normal, cache=TRUE}
sampledataDF <- data.frame(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt_div))
aov.shannon <- aov(Shannon ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF)
#Call for the summary of that ANOVA, which will include P-values
summary(aov.shannon)
```

Ok, the results of the ANOVA are significant.  Here we use the Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) post-hoc test to determine which pairwise comparisons are different.
```{r tukey, cache=TRUE}
TukeyHSD(aov.shannon)
```

Looks like *Sparisoma aurofrenatum* is significantly different from *Scarus taeniopterus* and *Acanthurus tractus*.

<br/>

#### Non-normally distributed

Now we can look at the results on the  inverse Simpson diversity and Chao’s richness. Since host species is categorical, we use Kruskal-Wallis (non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA) to test for significance.


Kruskal-Wallis of **inverse Simpson** index.

```{r krusk_invsimp, cache=TRUE}
#library(FSA)
#dunnTest(InvSimpson ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF, method="bh")
kruskal.test(InvSimpson ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF)
```

Kruskal-Wallis of **Chao1 richness** estimator.

```{r krusk_chao, cache=TRUE}
#dunnTest(Chao1 ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF, method="bh")
kruskal.test(Chao1 ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF)
```

Kruskal-Wallis of **Observed ASV richness** index.

```{r krusk_observed, cache=TRUE}
#library(FSA)
#dunnTest(Observed ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF, method="bh")
kruskal.test(Observed ~ Sp, data = sampledataDF)
```

For the inverse Simpson, Chao1, and Observed richness the results of the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test are significant. So we can look at pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxon rank sum test for post-hoc analysis.

Pairwise significance test for **inverse Simpson** index.

```{r wilcox_invsimp, cache=TRUE}
pairwise.wilcox.test(sampledataDF$InvSimpson, sampledataDF$Sp,
                     p.adjust.method = "fdr")
```

Pairwise significance test for **Chao1 richness** estimator.
```{r wilcox_chao, cache=TRUE}
pairwise.wilcox.test(sampledataDF$Chao1, sampledataDF$Sp,
                     p.adjust.method = "fdr")
```

Pairwise significance test for **Observed ASV richness** index.

```{r wilcox_observed, warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
pairwise.wilcox.test(sampledataDF$Observed, sampledataDF$Sp,
                     p.adjust.method = "fdr")
```

Again we see that only *Sp. aurofrenatum* is significantly different from the other hosts. For the inverse Simpson index, *Sp. aurofrenatum* is  significantly different from three of the four host species and Chao1 richness estimator, *Sp. aurofrenatum* is significantly different from all other host species. Now we can plot the results.

<br/>

### Diversity plots

Here we plot results from the Shannon diversity index. We will save a copy of the figure for later tweaking. We use the color palette described above to delineate host species.


<div class="paper">Figure 2B from paper</div>


```{r alpha_div_fig_2B, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Figure 2B", warning = FALSE, cache=TRUE}

### Correlations with diversity

Next we wanted to know if any alpha-diversity metrics were correlated with host physical characteristics. At the time of collection, we recorded host weight, total length, total gut length, as well as the length of individual gut segments (fore, mid, hind).

When considering the dataset as a whole (i.e., all samples), we found no correlation between any physical characteristics and any diversity metrics. If we split samples by genera we found that neither *Acanthurus* nor *Scarus* were not significant for any parameters while *Sparisoma* showed significant results for all parameters except hindgut_length.


```{r run_correlations, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
dt <- read.table("DATA/PHYLOSEQ/TABLES/OUTPUT/SUPP/Table_S3.txt",
                 sep = "\t", header = TRUE)
library(ggpubr)
scarus <- host_summary[host_summary$host_genus %in% "Scarus", ]
sparisoma <- host_summary[host_summary$host_genus %in% "Sparisoma", ]
acanthurus <- host_summary[host_summary$host_genus %in% "Acanthurus", ]
alphametric <- c("total_ASVs", "Chao1", "ACE", "Shannon",
                "Simpson",  "InvSimpson", "Fisher")
physical_char <- c("weight", "total_length", "foregut_length",
                   "midgut_length", "hindgut_length", "total_gut_length")

# Full set: not significant -> "weight", "total_length"
            #"foregut_length", R = 0.32
            #"midgut_length", R = 0.50
            #"hindgut_length", R = 0.17-0.34
            #"total_gut_length" R = 0.50

#By genus and midgut_length :
          # scarus NS
          # sparisoma R = 0.8
          # acanthurus NS

# acanthurus not significant for any parameters
# scarus not significant for any parameters
# sparisoma  significant for all parameters except hindgut_length was a bit weak
# "weight", "total_length" "foregut_length" "midgut_length"

# To do all diversity metric  change "y = " to y = alphametric and

par(mfrow = c(2, 3))
shan_by_length <- ggscatter(host_summary, x = "total_gut_length",
                            y = "Shannon", add = "reg.line",

## Beta-Diversity

Beta diversity basically tells us how similar or dissimilar samples are to one another. Phyloseq offers several ordination `methods` and `distance` metrics. Here we use non metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) coupled with Jensen–Shannon divergence. We also save a copy of the figure for later tweaking.

<p id="warning">
The results of the NMDS analysis are long. To see the full output remove the `results = 'hide'` tag from the code chunk.
</p>

```{r run_nmds, results = 'hide', cache=TRUE}
set.seed(3131)
ord.nmds.jsd_slv <- ordinate(ps_slv_work_filt, method = "NMDS",
                             distance = "jsd")
stressplot(ord.nmds.jsd_slv)
```

```{r ord_results, echo = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
ord.nmds.jsd_slv
```
We see that a convergent solution was reached around 20 iterations and our stress is below 0.20, meaning that 2-axes are sufficient to view the data. Generally, we are looking for stress values below 0.2. If the stress values are high, you may need to add more axes to the ordination. Lets visualize the plot.

<br/>

### Diversity plots

Here we plot  results from the Jensen-Shannon divergence. We will save a copy of the figure for later tweaking. We use the color palette described above to delineate host species.

<div class="paper">Figure 2C from paper</div>

```{r beta_div_fig_2C, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Figure 2C", cache=TRUE}
fig2C <- plot_ordination(ps_slv_work_filt, ord.nmds.jsd_slv,
                         color = "Sp", label = "SamName",
                         title = "Jensen-Shannon divergence")

fig2C <- fig2C + geom_point(size = 4) +
  geom_point(shape = 1, size = 3.6, colour = "black", stroke = 0.75)
# +  xlim(-0.4, 0.4) + ylim(-0.4, 0.4)

fig2C <- fig2C + scale_colour_manual(values = samp_pal)

fig2C <- fig2C + theme(axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
                       panel.background = element_blank(),
                       panel.grid.major = element_line("grey"),
                       panel.grid.minor = element_line("grey"),
                       panel.border =
                         element_rect(colour = "black", fill = NA, size = 1)) +
  theme(legend.key = element_rect(colour = "black"))

fig2C <- fig2C + coord_fixed()
fig2C <- fig2C  + stat_ellipse(type = "t") + theme_bw()
fig2C
pdf("DATA/PHYLOSEQ/FIGURES/OUTPUT/Figure_2C.pdf")
fig2C
invisible(dev.off())
```

So we can see some clustering within groups and spread between groups, but this is not a test for statistical differences. Do microbial communities differ significantly by host taxa?

<br/>

### PERMANOVA

To test whether microbial communities differ by host species we can use permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) or analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). PERMANOVA does not assume normality but does assume equal beta dispersion between groups. We will test beta dispersion below.

First  we use the `adonis` function in vegan to run a PERMANOVA test. This will tell us whether host species have similar centroids or not.

```{r ordination_stats_adonis, cache=TRUE}
set.seed(1911)
fish.jsd <- phyloseq::distance(ps_slv_work_filt, method = "jsd")
sampledf <- data.frame(sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt))
fish_adonis <- adonis(fish.jsd ~ Sp, data = sampledf, permutations = 1000)
fish_adonis
```

These results indicate that centroids are significantly different across host species meaning that communities are different by host species.

We can also use the `pairwiseAdonis` package for pair-wise PERMANOVA analysis.

```{r pairwise_adonis, cache=TRUE}
pairwise.adonis(fish.jsd, factors = sampledf$Sp, p.adjust.m = "bonferroni")
```

Here we see  again we see that communities are different by host species.

However, PERMANOVA assumes equal beta dispersion so we will  use the `betadisper` function from the `vegan` package to calculate beta dispersion values.

```{r betadisper, cache=TRUE}
beta_adonis <- betadisper(fish.jsd, sampledf$Sp, bias.adjust = TRUE)
beta_adonis
```

And then a pair-wise Permutation test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersions using `permutest` (again from the `vegan` package).
```{r permutest, cache=TRUE}
permutest(beta_adonis, pairwise = TRUE, permutations = 1000)
```

These results are significant, meaning that  host species have different dispersions. Looking at the pairwise p-values and permuted p-value, we see that the  significant differences (p-value < 0.05) are between:

* SpAur & AcCoe, AcTra
* ScTae & AcCoe, AcTra, SpVir

This means we are less confident that the PERMANOVA result is a real result, and that the result is possibly due to differences in group dispersions.

<br/>

### ANOSIM

We can also use Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM)---which does not assume equal group variances---to test whether overall microbial communities differ by host species.

```{r ordination_stats_anosim, cache=TRUE}
spgroup <- get_variable(ps_slv_work_filt, "Sp")
fish_anosim <- anosim(distance(ps_slv_work_filt, "jsd"), grouping = spgroup)
summary(fish_anosim)
```

And the AN0SIM result is significant meaning that host species influences microbial community composition.

```{r simper, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE, cache=TRUE}
source("HELPER_SCRIPTS/simper_pretty.R")
#Using the function
otutab <- as.table(otu_table(ps_slv_work_filt))
stuff <- simper.pretty(otu_table(ps_slv_work_filt),
                       sample_data(ps_slv_work_filt), "Sp",
                       perc_cutoff = 0.5, low_cutoff = "y",
                       low_val = 0.01, "name")
```

```{r save_2, include = FALSE, cache=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# This is for initial processing only. After caching eval not needed}
save.image(file = "DATA/RDS/pw_div_3.rds")
```
