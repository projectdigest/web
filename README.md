Site for herbivore fish microbiome paper.

This is the build directory for the website (https://github.com/projectdigest/projectdigest.github.io). When the site is rendered in RStudio the following are erased:

`.git/`
`.gitignore`
`.nojekyll`

And I have to `git push` data from two directories. Need to fix this :/
